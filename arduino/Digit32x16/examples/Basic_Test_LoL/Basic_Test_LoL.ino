 This needs the Charlieplexing library, which you can get at the
 LoL Shield project page: http://code.google.com/p/lolshield/

The BitMap array is what contains the frame data. Each line is one full frame.
Since each number is 16 bits, we can easily fit all 16 LEDs per row into it.
The number is calculated by adding up all the bits, starting with lowest on
the left of each row. TERMINATER was chosen as the kill number, so make sure that
is at the end of the matrix, or the program will continue to read into memory.

Here PROGMEM is called, which stores the array into ROM, which leaves us
with our RAM. You cannot change the array during run-time, only when you
upload to the Arduino. You will need to pull it out of ROM, which is covered
below. If you want it to stay in RAM, just delete PROGMEM
